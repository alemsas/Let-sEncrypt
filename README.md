# Let-sEncrypt
You can get a free certificate from Let's Encrypt

This is my first project on Github! I wrote this shell for anyone who wants to get a certificate for their server!

1.Clone the cert.sh file
```
git clone https://github.com/alemsas/Let-sEncrypt.git && cd Let-sEncrypt/
```
2.Run
```
chmod +x cert.sh
```
3.Run
```
./cert/sh
```

I need your kindness!
